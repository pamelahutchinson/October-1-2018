<h2>Hello stranger.</h2>
<h3>You are now about to die of cuteness. I present you the Pitbull breed:</h3>

<p> 5% of all dogs registered in the US are Pit Bulls, but 20% of dogs in shelters are pit bulls. <br>
    According to the American Temperament Test Society Inc, Pit Bulls pass their test 87% of the time. That ranks them as 4th best of 122 breeds tested!<br> You are 240 times more likely to die in a texting-while-driving accident than from a Pit Bull attack. You are 18 times more likely to die falling out of bed than from a Pit Bull Attack. You are 16 times more lilely to die from being hit by a falling coconut than from a Pit Bull attack. Get the picture yet?<br>In the early 20th century Pit Bulls were known as “nanny dogs” or “nursemaids” because they were so trusted around children. <br> <br>
