<h2>Hello stranger.</h2>
<h3>You are now about to die of cuteness. I present you the Maltese breed:</h3>

<p> The Maltese is one of the oldest-known breeds of dogs, and is said to be over 2800 years old. The small dogs happily sat on the laps of the Ancient Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians.<br>
    Sporting a thick coat of hair instead of fur, these little dogs donâ€™t shed. Instead, they need occasional haircuts to keep their mops in check. Their white tufts are hypoallergenic, making them great for families with allergies. <br> Though they be but little, they can jump. They also seem to have no fear of gravity and have no problem leaping out of your arms or off high ledges. <br>The Maltese standards describe these dogs as loving and gentle, but also fearless and loyal. You can count on yours to come to your aid no matter what. <br> <br>
