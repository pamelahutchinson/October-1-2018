<h2>Hello stranger.</h2>
<h3>You are now about to die of cuteness. I present you the Pug breed:</h3>

<p> Pugs belong to the companion classification of dogs. Despite their stocky, muscular build, they are part of the toy group. Fully grown, these pups are 10 to 12 inches tall and weigh between 14 and 20 pounds. The average Pug life span is 12 to 15 years. With their gentle, playful personalities and sturdy bodies, Pugs make great canine companions for families with small children. <br>Although they’re small, Pugs can be dependable watchdogs. They are welcoming to strangers when their pet parents approve, but they still know how to guard their castle. Pugs aren’t “yappy” dogs and are fairly inactive, which makes them great for apartment dwellers. Although what they lack in yapping, they make up for in other sounds…like wheezing, snorting, and snoring! <br> <br>
